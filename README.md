# chartlytics 

Chart images play a vital role in visualizing data, but automatically extracting the values from these charts poses a significant challenge. The diverse range of chart styles makes it difficult to employ pure rule-based data extraction methods effectively. Developing a system that generates textual descriptions of images would improve the accessibility of digital content for individuals with visual impairments. <br><br> To address this issue, we developed Chartlytics, a user-friendly, accessible application that can create textual descriptions for given a chart image and display them for the user in the form of a plain understandable text or a sound that people with complete loss of vision can easily hear.

<h2> Objectives </h2>
<ol>
<li>Extract charts from documents.
<li>Train a model that accurately classifies chart types.
<li>Extract data from chart images in a format that can help in analyzing this data.
<li>Develop a user-friendly application that is accessible for everyone.
<li>Solve the problem of OCR and screen readers where they fail to read chart content from images.
<li>Train an  image captioning model for non-chart images in documents.
</ol>
