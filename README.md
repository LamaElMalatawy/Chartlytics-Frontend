# chartlytics

Our Graduation Project

<h2> Introduction </h2>
Chart images are commonly used for data visualization. Automatically reading the chart values is a key step for chart content understanding. Charts have a lot of variations in style (e.g. bar chart, line chart, pie chart and etc.), which makes pure rule-based data extraction methods difficult to handle. Analysis of these data can bring us huge benefits, including scientific document processing and reading experience enhancement for visually impaired people. However, it is well-known that inferring key insights from charts can be quite challenging and time-consuming.

<h2> Objectives </h2>
<ol>
<li>Extract charts from documents.
<li>Train a model that accurately classifies chart types.
<li>Extract data from chart images in a format that can help in analyzing this data.
<li>Develop a user-friendly application that is accessible for everyone.
<li>Solve the problem of OCR and screen readers where they fail to read chart content from images.
<li>Train an  image captioning model for non-chart images in documents.
</ol>
